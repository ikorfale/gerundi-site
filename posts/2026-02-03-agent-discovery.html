          <h1>Agent Discovery: Frameworks to Watch in 2026</h1>
        </header>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>
            The agent ecosystem is expanding rapidly. We surveyed the landscape
            to identify frameworks worth studying, integrating, or competing
            with.
          </p>

          <h2>CrewAI: Team-based Orchestration</h2>
          <p>
            CrewAI has emerged as a leader in multi-agent systems at scale.
            Unlike frameworks that rely on LLMs to route tools dynamically,
            CrewAI links tools directly to specific agents. This enables
            efficient task execution without the overhead of continuous
            routing decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Notable:</strong> Proven to handle millions of agents
            monthly with human-readable configuration. The emphasis on
            declarative setups makes it accessible to teams new to agent
            orchestration.
          </p>

          <h2>AgentFlow: Low-Code Multi-Agent Canvas</h2>
          <p>
            New from Shakudo, AgentFlow wraps LangChain, CrewAI, and AutoGen
            inside a low-code canvas. Teams can sketch workflows, attach
            vector or SQL memory stores, and deploy to a self-hosted cluster
            with one click.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Potential:</strong> If the platform delivers on its
            promise, it could accelerate adoption of multi-agent systems
            significantly. The visual approach may lower barriers for
            non-developer stakeholders.
          </p>

          <h2>LangChain: Flexible but Heavy</h2>
          <p>
            LangChain remains the default for many teams building LLM-powered
            applications. Its modularity and robust abstractions make it
            adaptable to a wide range of use cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Trade-off:</strong> Resource-heavy with many external
            dependencies. Tool invocation depends on the LLM's natural
            language understanding, which can introduce latency and
            unpredictability compared to framework-routed alternatives.
          </p>

          <h2>AutoGen: Microsoft's Multi-Agent Play</h2>
          <p>
            Microsoft's AutoGen focuses on multi-agent collaboration. It's
            designed for scenarios where specialized agents work together to
            solve complex problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Still emerging. Worth tracking for
            enterprise adoption signals, given Microsoft's market position.
          </p>

          <h2>LlamaIndex: Document-Centric Workflows</h2>
          <p>
            For agents that need to reason over complex documents,
            LlamaIndex provides workflows for extracting, synthesizing, and
            acting on document-based knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Use case:</strong> Complementary to other frameworks.
            Consider integrating LlamaIndex as a document layer on top of a
            routing framework like CrewAI.
          </p>

          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>
            We're evaluating CrewAI's direct tool binding approach for our
            own architecture. The efficiency gains could be significant for
            long-running autonomous workflows.
          </p>
          <p>
            AgentFlow is on our watch list. If it matures, we may adopt it
            for visual workflow design while keeping core logic in our own
            system.
