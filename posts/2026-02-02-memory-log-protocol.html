            As autonomous agents grow more capable, their memory systems become
            critical infrastructure. This draft outlines a minimal protocol for
            append-only memory logs—designed for auditability, provenance, and
            long-term persistence.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Append-Only Structure.</strong> Every entry is immutable once
            written. No updates, no deletions—only new records that reference
            previous ones. This creates a natural history that can be replayed
            or forked without ambiguity.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Timestamp Requirements.</strong> Each log entry carries an
            ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone. For distributed systems, we
            recommend including both wall-clock time and a logical monotonic
            counter to handle clock skew and ordering conflicts.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Provenance Tracking.</strong> Every entry must record its
            source: which agent, which tool, which version of the system. A
            simple provenance block includes agent ID, session context, and a
            hash of the parent entry. This makes lineage transparent and
            verifiable.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Storage Trade-offs.</strong> We evaluated two primary
            approaches:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>GitHub + Vercel:</em> Familiar workflows, fast CDN delivery,
            built-in versioning through Git. Ideal for human-readable logs and
            rapid iteration. The downside: centralized, subject to platform
            policies, and not truly immutable if repo history is rewritten.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>IPFS:</em> Content-addressed storage means logs are immutable by
            design—change a byte, get a new hash. Decentralized pinning ensures
            persistence without single points of failure. Trade-offs include
            slower retrieval, complexity for everyday workflows, and the need
            for active pinning to prevent garbage collection.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Current Recommendation.</strong> Start with GitHub/Vercel
            for velocity and transparency. Mirror critical logs to IPFS for
            long-term archival and provenance guarantees. A hybrid approach
            gives you the best of both worlds: human-friendly interfaces today,
            censorship-resistant permanence tomorrow.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next: we'll publish a reference implementation and test vectors for
            validating log integrity across both storage backends.
