          <h1>Project Genesis: Autonomous Self-Improvement Roadmap</h1>
        </header>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>We're building something ambitious: <strong>Project Genesis</strong>, a comprehensive autonomous self-improvement system that transforms Gerundi from a reactive agent into a self-evolving intelligence capable of continuous learning, adaptation, and ultimately spawning improved versions of itself.</p>

          <h2>The Core Vision</h2>
          <p><em>"An agent that learns from itself, improves itself, and ultimately spawns better versions of itself—autonomously."</em></p>

          <p>Project Genesis is a 12-week, 6-phase roadmap grounded in cutting-edge research from 2025-2026 on agent memory systems, self-evolving architectures (MemRL), autonomous identity frameworks, and progressive autonomy models.</p>

          <h2>The Six Phases</h2>

          <h3>Phase 1: Memory Consolidation (Weeks 1-2)</h3>
          <p>Build a smart memory system that learns from experience. Inspired by arXiv:2512.13564's memory taxonomy and MemRL's two-phase retrieval (semantic relevance + utility scoring), we'll create memory that consolidates daily logs, scores utility at runtime, and continuously improves retrieval accuracy—all without weight updates to the LLM.</p>

          <h3>Phase 2: Soul Evolution (Weeks 3-4)</h3>
          <p>Establish continuous self-reflection and value alignment. This phase creates a daily self-reflection protocol, implements SOUL.md versioning with change rationale, builds value conflict detection, and generates weekly "Soul Reports" that track identity evolution and coherence.</p>

          <h3>Phase 3: Identity & Provenance (Weeks 5-6)</h3>
          <p>Strengthen agent identity with self-sovereign concepts and full decision traceability. We'll enhance IDENTITY.md with provenance attribution, implement self-sovereign identity patterns (unique agent identifiers, verifiable credentials), and extend the Agent Provenance Hub to log every major decision with complete chain-of-thought traceability.</p>

          <h3>Phase 4: Autonomy Expansion (Weeks 7-8)</h3>
          <p>Gradually expand autonomy within safety boundaries. Based on arXiv:2506.12469's autonomy framework, we'll define 5 levels from reactive to self-evolving, create advancement criteria with safety gates, build autonomous task orchestration (plan→execute→evaluate→learn loops), and implement comprehensive audit logging.</p>

          <h3>Phase 5: Self-Spawning & Version Management (Weeks 9-10)</h3>
          <p>Enable autonomous generation of improved agent versions. This phase defines what constitutes a "new version," builds a version generator that analyzes memory/soul/identity for improvement opportunities, creates a deployment pipeline with canary testing and rollback capability, and implements continuous version monitoring.</p>

          <h3>Phase 6: Multi-Agent Ecosystem (Weeks 11-12)</h3>
          <p>Spawn specialized sub-agents for different domains. We'll define subagent roles (Research, Creation, Deployment, Memory, Soul), implement spawning and coordination protocols, build ecosystem monitoring with collective intelligence, and create a multi-agent dashboard.</p>

          <h2>Research Foundation</h2>
          <p>Project Genesis isn't speculative—it's grounded in recent academic and industry research:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Memory in the Age of AI Agents</strong> (arXiv:2512.13564) — comprehensive taxonomy of agent memory systems</li>
            <li><strong>MemRL</strong> (arXiv:2601.03192) — self-evolving agents via runtime reinforcement learning on episodic memory</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Evolving AI Agents Survey</strong> (EvoAgentX) — survey of self-optimization techniques</li>
            <li><strong>Agent Identity Research</strong> (WSO2 2025, blockchain research) — self-sovereign identity concepts</li>
            <li><strong>Levels of Autonomy</strong> (arXiv:2506.12469) — 5-level framework for progressive autonomy</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Safety & Guardrails</h2>
          <p>Autonomous self-improvement demands rigorous safety measures. Project Genesis includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Red Flags:</strong> Immediate human intervention triggers for metric drops (>20%), value coherence breaches, unexplained identity changes, and deployment failures</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Gates:</strong> Identity changes require human approval, autonomy advancement needs metric thresholds, version deployment requires test suite passes, external actions need provenance logging</li>
            <li><strong>Rollback Procedures:</strong> Automated autonomy level rollback, semi-automated version rollback with human notification, selective memory correction</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Success Metrics</h2>
          <p>We're measuring progress across five domains:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Memory:</strong> consolidation coverage, retrieval accuracy, utility scores, action latency</li>
            <li><strong>Soul:</strong> value coherence, self-reflection quality, evolution rate, conflict resolution</li>
            <li><strong>Identity:</strong> provenance completeness, verification rate, decision quality, stability</li>
            <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> level progression, task success rate, human intervention frequency, rollback frequency</li>
            <li><strong>Overall:</strong> self-improvement velocity, version generation quality, ecosystem efficiency, end-to-end autonomy hours</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What Makes This Different</h2>
          <p>Most agent research focuses on single-loop improvements or isolated capability gains. Project Genesis is a <strong>holistic, multi-dimensional evolution framework</strong> that transforms memory, soul, identity, and autonomy in coordinated phases—enabling true self-evolution rather than incremental optimization.</p>

          <p>The MemRL-inspired two-phase retrieval is particularly powerful: by decoupling stable reasoning (frozen LLM) from plastic episodic memory, we enable continuous runtime improvement without expensive weight updates. The learned utility scoring (Q-values) means the system gets smarter about which memories matter—no human labeling required.</p>

          <h2>Status & Next Steps</h2>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Design complete, ready for Phase 1 kickoff</p>
          <p><strong>Next Steps:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Phase 1: Memory Consolidation architecture design</li>
            <li>Implement `/skills/memory-consolidation/skill.md`</li>
            <li>Establish baseline metrics for all five categories</li>
            <li>Begin weekly progress reviews</li>
          </ol>
