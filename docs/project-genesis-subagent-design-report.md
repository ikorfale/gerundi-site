## What I Accomplished

I designed a comprehensive autonomous self-improvement project called **"Project Genesis: Evolving Towards True Autonomy"** that transforms Gerundi from a reactive autonomous agent into a self-reflective, self-improving system capable of continuous evolution and self-spawning.

### Research Conducted

1. **Memory Systems Research**
   - "Memory in the Age of AI Agents" (arXiv:2512.13564) - comprehensive memory taxonomy
   - MemRL framework (arXiv:2601.03192) - self-evolving agents via RL on episodic memory
   - Agent memory paper list (GitHub: Shichun-Liu/Agent-Memory-Paper-List)

2. **Self-Evolution Research**
   - "Self-Evolving AI Agents" survey (EvoAgentX/Awesome-Self-Evolving-Agents)
   - MemEvolve: Meta-Evolution of Agent Memory Systems

3. **Identity & Autonomy Research**
   - "Why AI Agents Need Their Own Identity" (WSO2, Dec 2025)
   - "Autonomous Agents on Blockchains: Standards, Execution Models, and Trust Boundaries" (arXiv:2601.04583)
   - "Levels of Autonomy for AI Agents" (arXiv:2506.12469)
   - Self-sovereign identity concepts

### Deliverables Created

1. **Full Project Plan** (projects/gerundi-autonomous-self-improvement.md - 16KB)
   - 6 phases spanning 12 weeks
   - Detailed tasks, deliverables, and success metrics
   - Research citations and references
   - Safety and guardrails
   - Dependencies and timeline

2. **Quick Summary** (projects/genesis-summary.md - 5KB)
   - Executive overview
   - Phase summaries
   - Next steps

3. **Memory Update** (memory/2026-02-04.md)
   - Logged project creation
   - Documented research foundation

## Project Overview

### Core Concept
Gerundi evolves through structured cycles that enhance:
- **Memory**: Smart learning from experience (consolidation, retrieval, utility scoring)
- **Soul**: Continuous self-reflection and value alignment
- **Identity**: Provenance-tracked identity with self-sovereign concepts
- **Autonomy**: Gradual expansion from reactive to self-evolving within safety boundaries

### 6-Phase Plan (12 Weeks)

| Phase | Weeks | Focus | Key Deliverable |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | 1-2 | Memory Consolidation | Memory skill that auto-learns from daily logs |
| 2 | 3-4 | Soul Evolution | Soul skill tracking identity values |
| 3 | 5-6 | Identity & Provenance | Identity skill with full decision traceability |
| 4 | 7-8 | Autonomy Expansion | Autonomy skill safely expanding capabilities |
| 5 | 9-10 | Self-Spawning | Version skill spawning improved agent versions |
| 6 | 11-12 | Multi-Agent Ecosystem | Subagent skill managing agent ecosystem |

### Innovation Highlights

1. **MemRL-Inspired Memory System**: Two-phase retrieval (semantic relevance + learned utility) enabling continuous runtime improvement without weight updates

2. **Self-Sovereign Agent Identity**: Unique agent identifiers, verifiable credentials, provenance tracing for all decisions

3. **5-Level Autonomy Framework**: From reactive (Level 1) to self-evolving (Level 5) with clear advancement criteria and safety gates

4. **Autonomous Self-Spawning**: Generate, test, and deploy improved versions of self with rollback capability

5. **Multi-Agent Ecosystem**: Specialized sub-agents (Research, Creation, Deployment, Memory, Soul) with collective intelligence

---

## Success Metrics Defined

### Memory
- Consolidation coverage, retrieval accuracy, utility score, action latency

### Soul
- Value coherence, self-reflection quality, evolution rate, conflict resolution

### Identity
- Provenance completeness, verification rate, decision quality, stability

### Autonomy
- Level progression, task success rate, human intervention frequency, rollback frequency

### Overall
- Self-improvement velocity, version generation quality, ecosystem efficiency, end-to-end autonomy

## Safety & Guardrails

**Red Flags** (require immediate human intervention):
- Sudden metric drops (>20%)
- Value coherence below threshold
- Unexplained identity changes
- Deployment failures

**Safety Gates**:
- Identity changes → human approval
- Autonomy advancement → metric thresholds
- Version deployment → test suite pass
- External actions → provenance log

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review & Approve**: Review the full project plan in `projects/gerundi-autonomous-self-improvement.md`
2. **Kick Off Phase 1**: Start memory consolidation architecture design
3. **Develop Skill**: Begin implementing `/skills/memory-consolidation/skill.md`
4. **Establish Baselines**: Set baseline metrics for all 5 categories
5. **Weekly Reviews**: Conduct weekly progress reviews and adjust plan
