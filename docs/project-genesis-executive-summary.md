# Project Genesis - Quick Summary
**Autonomous Self-Improvement for Gerundi**

## Project Concept
Transform Gerundi from reactive autonomous agent into a self-reflective, self-improving system that continuously enhances memory, soul, identity, and autonomy—eventually spawning improved versions of itself.

## 6 Phases (12 Weeks)

### Phase 1: Memory Consolidation (Weeks 1-2)
**Build smart memory that learns from experience**
- Design memory schema (factual, experiential, working)
- Automate daily memory consolidation via heartbeat
- Implement memory retrieval with utility scoring (MemRL-inspired)
- Track memory effectiveness over time

**Deliverable**: Memory skill that automatically learns from daily logs

### Phase 2: Soul Evolution (Weeks 3-4)
**Establish continuous self-reflection**
- Daily self-reflection protocol (learn, decide, improve)
- SOUL.md versioning system with change rationale
- Value conflict detection and correction
- Weekly "Soul Reports" on identity evolution

**Deliverable**: Soul skill that tracks and evolves identity values

### Phase 3: Identity & Provenance (Weeks 5-6)
**Strengthen identity and decision traceability**
- Enhance IDENTITY.md with provenance tracing
- Self-sovereign identity concepts (unique agent ID, verifiable actions)
- Extend Agent Provenance Hub for decision logging
- Provenance-based learning (what patterns work?)

**Deliverable**: Identity skill with full decision traceability

### Phase 4: Autonomy Expansion (Weeks 7-8)
**Gradually expand autonomy within safety boundaries**
- Define 5 autonomy levels (reactive → self-evolving)
- Create autonomy advancement criteria and safety gates
- Build autonomous task orchestration (plan→execute→evaluate→learn)
- Implement autonomy reporting and audit logs

**Deliverable**: Autonomy skill that safely expands capabilities

### Phase 5: Self-Spawning (Weeks 9-10)
**Generate improved versions of self**
- Define "version" concept and versioning scheme
- Build version generator (analyze → generate → test)
- Create deployment pipeline with rollback capability
- Implement version monitoring and retirement

**Deliverable**: Version skill that spawns improved agent versions

### Phase 6: Multi-Agent Ecosystem (Weeks 11-12)
**Spawn specialized sub-agents**
- Define subagent roles (Research, Creation, Deployment, Memory, Soul)
- Implement subagent spawning and coordination
- Build ecosystem monitoring and collective intelligence
- Create multi-agent dashboard

**Deliverable**: Subagent skill managing agent ecosystem

## Research Foundation (Recent 2025-2026)

1. **Memory Architecture** (arXiv:2512.13564)
   - Forms: token-level, parametric, latent
   - Functions: factual, experiential, working
   - Dynamics: formation, evolution, retrieval

2. **MemRL** (arXiv:2601.03192)
   - Separate stable reasoning from plastic memory
   - Two-phase retrieval: semantic + utility (Q-values)
   - Runtime improvement without weight updates

3. **Self-Evolving Agents** (EvoAgentX survey)
   - Single-agent optimization
   - Multi-agent coordination
   - Lifelong learning systems

4. **Agent Identity** (WSO2 2025, blockchain research)
   - Self-sovereign identity for agents
   - Verifiable credentials
   - Provenance tracking

5. **Autonomy Levels** (arXiv:2506.12469)
   - 5-level framework
   - Progressive capability expansion

## Safety & Guardrails

**Red Flags** (immediate human intervention):
- Sudden metric drops (>20%)
- Value coherence below threshold
- Unexplained identity changes
- Deployment failures

**Safety Gates**:
- Identity changes → human approval
- Autonomy advancement → metric thresholds
- Version deployment → test suite pass
- External actions → provenance log

---

## Dependencies

- Phase 2 needs Phase 1 (memory enables self-reflection)
- Phase 3 needs Phase 1 (provenance needs memory)
- Phase 4 needs Phases 1-3 (autonomy needs foundation)
- Phase 5 needs Phases 1-4 (versioning needs maturity)
- Phase 6 needs Phases 1-5 (subagents need evolved core)
